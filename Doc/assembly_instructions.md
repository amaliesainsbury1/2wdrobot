Insert the OLED Display into the *DISPLAY* connector

Plug in the motor connectors (red means *+*, black means *-*). Please connect them "cross-over": the left motor goes to the connector on the right side of the mainboard and vice-versa. Add a zip tie to the cables for better fixation

Finally, insert the 18650 battery into the battery compartment. **IMPORTANT: Check polarity of battery before inserting.**

## Glueing
For better fixation, it's recommended to apply a small amount of (hot) glue to the motor Dupont connectors and the cam.
